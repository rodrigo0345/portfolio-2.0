            I'm a <strong>student</strong> at the University of Minho, currently in the 3rd year of the course. 
            I'm passionate about <strong>software development</strong> and <strong>IT</strong> in general, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

            Lately I have been eager to learn more about <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>.NET</strong> as a whole, as I though it would be a great addition to my <strong>TypeScript</strong>/Node.js skillset.
